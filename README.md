## üîç Models Overview

### üîπ Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
The **VAE** is a powerful generative model that learns a latent representation of the input data, which can be used to generate new, unseen data samples. VAEs are particularly useful for unsupervised learning and data generation tasks.

### üîπ Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
The **GAN** framework consists of two neural networks‚Äîthe generator and the discriminator‚Äîthat compete against each other. The generator creates fake data samples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake samples. Through this adversarial process, the generator improves its ability to create realistic data.

### üîπ Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
The **cGAN** extends the GAN by conditioning the data generation process on additional information, such as class labels. This allows for more controlled generation of images, enabling the creation of samples with specific attributes or belonging to a particular class.

### üîπ Diffusion Models
**Diffusion Models** are a class of generative models that learn to simulate the diffusion process, a gradual transformation of data through a stochastic system. These models are particularly powerful for generating high-quality samples that follow a complex distribution.

### üîπ Conditional Diffusion Models
**Conditional Diffusion Models** take the idea of diffusion models further by conditioning the generation process on auxiliary information, similar to cGANs. This enables the model to generate data that adheres to specific conditions or classes, making it a versatile tool for controlled data generation.
